  - 100% database connectivity for all state changes
  - Style reference compliance (/frontend/style-reference)
```

#### 2. **frontend.mdc** - Style Reference Compliance
```yaml
Key Requirements:
  - /frontend/style-reference is SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
  - Zero deviation policy from style-reference patterns
  - Component reuse priority over custom creation
  - Exact same styling systems and design tokens

```

#### 3. **dynamic.mdc** - Next.js Dynamic Rendering
```yaml
Key Requirements:

### Content Overlap Analysis

#### High-Value Unique Content:
1. **Latest Audit Documents** (Current branch) - Most accurate analysis
2. **Style Reference Compliance Audits** (system-audit branch) - Critical for frontend rules
3. **Emergency Implementation Plans** (system-audit branch) - Production readiness
4. **Updated Requirements Status** (platform-status branch) - Accurate status tracking

#### Conflict Resolution:
- **Document conflicts**: Keep most recent and comprehensive versions
- **Code conflicts**: Prioritize security fixes and compliance improvements
- **Rule conflicts**: Follow strictest compliance requirements

## üõ†Ô∏è MERGE EXECUTION PLAN

### Step 1: Prepare Master Integration Branch
```bash
# Create integration branch from current comprehensive audit branch
git checkout cursor/full-code-audit-and-quality-assurance-150e
git checkout -b master-integration-2025

# Ensure clean working directory
git status
```

### Step 2: Strategic Cherry-Pick Merges
```bash
# Merge 1: System audit and style reference content
git cherry-pick origin/cursor/full-system-audit-refactor-and-production-deployment-e8fc

# Merge 2: Platform status update
git cherry-pick origin/cursor/update-platform-status-from-markdown-files-9726

# Merge 3: Enterprise audit reports (selective)
git cherry-pick origin/cursor/audit-and-deploy-enterprise-platform-b783

# Merge 4: Context rules violations
git cherry-pick origin/cursor/run-bugbot-for-context-rule-enforcement-49e7
```

### Step 3: Conflict Resolution Protocol
```bash
For Each Conflict:
1. Analyze content value and accuracy
2. Prioritize most recent comprehensive analysis
3. Integrate complementary insights
4. Remove duplicated information
5. Ensure rule compliance consistency
6. Validate against context rules
```

### Step 4: Content Consolidation
```bash
Document Organization:
1. Audit Documents ‚Üí /audit-reports/
2. Implementation Plans ‚Üí /implementation-plans/
3. Status Reports ‚Üí /status-reports/
4. Rule Compliance ‚Üí /compliance-reports/
5. Keep root level for critical documents
```

### Step 5: Final Integration to Master
```bash
# After successful integration and testing
git checkout master
git merge master-integration-2025 --strategy=ours --strategy-option=theirs
git push origin master
